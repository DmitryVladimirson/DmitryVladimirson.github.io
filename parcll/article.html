                            <p>As international shipping improves, the European B2C market quickly becomes a viable segment for your business. To attract European customers in a competitive market place, e-tailers need to implement best-practice customer service models. By optimizing these customer service models, you will increase website traffic, streamline fulfillment, and reduce shipping time and cost. An e-tailer’s website, supply chain, and shipping are three key areas an e-commerce site can improve its customer service to serve its growing European B2C market.</p>

                                Customer service begins with an intuitive, well organized, and searchable website. But to expand to a more global B2C model, <span class="color ">your website needs to reflect its global customers.</span>

                            <p>User interface and experience is a crucial customer service model to grow website traffic and reduce bounce rates. If a customer has trouble navigating the site or can’t find desired products or services quickly, it leads to poor customer experience and lost sales.

Companies could stop losing overseas business by implementing some quick solutions to many of these usability issues.”

                            <p>Using localization services, e-tailers should offer a multilingual site. Many of the Top 500 e-commerce sites offer different global location points as an entryway into their website. Allowing the customer to select the region closest to their home country and language creates a welcoming environment where they will feel comfortable. <span class="color">Localization services provide a seamless transition of your website’s content to fit your visitor’s language and culture.</span> By building cultural flexibility into the site, you will convert more of your international traffic into sales. This trend is growing in popularity as shipping becomes more ubiquitous and eventually will become an industry standard.

                            <p>Webpages that takes too long to load become lost sales. In a culture of on-demand, webpages that load slower than three seconds can lose 40% of their traffic for medium to large e-commerce sites. And this holds true for European B2C. Effective ways to reduce load time include:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Reduce the number of images on a page</li>
                                <li>Optimizing and Compressing Images and files</li>
                                <li>Minimizing HTTP Requests</li>
                                <li>Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or a CDN Service Provider</li>
                                <li>Take advantage of Browser Caching</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>By lowering load time, your bounce rate will decrease. For European B2C, a CDN reduces load time significantly because CDNs are located closer to your international customers. CDNs speed up load times for e-commerce sites with high traffic volume, which helps with conversion.

                            <p>Properly managed inventory should be a no brainer but can prove a difficult task for medium to large e-commerce websites.

                            <p>Another successful customer service model is to offer a proactive approach to Out of Stock inventory. Setting clear and achievable back-order dates or sending an email notification for when the item is back in inventory will manage customer expectations. This can also help you with understanding product demand and growing your mailing list. For European customers, who often have longer delivery times, it will keep them informed and excited about your products.</p>

                                For e-commerce, your supply chain is critical from a customer service perspective. Order accuracy, supply, and fulfillment need to be flashpoints of efficiency and transparency to the customer. When optimized, retailers can reduce ship rates and costs, eliminate import/export taxes for customers, and hopefully reduce costs. By informing the customer throughout the fulfillment process, your customers will be satisfied with their purchase. This also helps manage the customer’s expectations when problems or issues arise during the process.

                            <p>By stating clear shipping costs to international customers, they can prepare for the added cost when they go to their shopping cart. There are a couple of ways e-tailers can do this. You can use a shipping calculator that customizes to the cost depending on the customer’s location. Or you can set standard rates for different international zones. These rates can vary depending on the international carrier you use. Unfortunately, these rates can change significantly between neighboring countries.
